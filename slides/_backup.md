# Why did I create this talk?

(Maybe don't show)

- Analysis Paralysis
- Not about tooling, rather people and practices
- Good Friction vs Bad Friction
- You can measure "faster", but can you really measure *better*?


---

# Cloud is a Journey

- Microsoft in its own cultural, cloud transformation
- Azure customers also on journey





being a knower, being right vs being a learner
lead from place of empahty, accountability and learning.

opimize for learning, not performance (why choose monorepo over multirepo)

 how to decide *if* you should adopt a practice 
 how *maybe* you can achieve the same results without tooling. ==> for every trend, the anti version


DevSecOps
Everything as Code
Pull Requests
Monitoring (maybe drop as SRE? for time)

### Everything as Code

> EaC introduces a world where our infrastructures, workflows, and services start to demonstrate the mature, programmatic, and resilient patterns weâ€™re used to:

- Version controlled and immutable
- Maintainable, testable, and collaborative
- Modular, composable, and separate
- Auto-scalable and resource-pool dynamically
- Predictable and consistent
- Linters and static analysis to enforce consistency
- Graceful self-healing and failovers
- No need for constant operator intervention
- Secure and upgradable

> EaC changes the focus from manual, repetitive tasks to workflows based on end goals and desired states. Bringing how we manage infrastructure closer to the maturity of how we build software.
