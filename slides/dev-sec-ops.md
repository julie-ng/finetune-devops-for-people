# DevSecOps

Notes:
- People love terms like this.
- Who _doesn't_ want security?
- Makes it sound easy: I don't need to think. Let <tool X> do it for me. 
- It'll even create a Pull Request to fix my problems.

## in real life…

![](../images/devsecops-1-warning.png)

No one in webinar commented on the security warnings 🤔 <!-- .element: class="caption-font" -->

Note:
- giving demo…
- no one asked about warning 🙃

### High Alert 🚨

![](../images/devsecops-2-dependabot-alerts.png)

There's 3 Dependabots? alerts, security updates and version updates 🤔 <!-- .element: class="caption-font" -->

Note:
- View dependabot alerts
- 2 dependencies
  - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check Moderate
  - glob-parent (npm) HIGH
  - Regular expression denial of service High
    nth-check (npm)

---

### Ok, help me 🤖

![](../images/devsecops-3-suggestion.png)

---

## OK, let's try it

```
"devDependencies": {
  "glob-parent": ">=5.1.2"
}
```

```shell
$ npm update
```

---

### 🤨

```
npm WARN …

- 15 Vulnerabilities? 😧<!-- .element: class="fragment caption-font" -->
- Dependabot said 2 high vulnerabilities 🙁 <!-- .element: class="fragment caption-font" -->

### $ npm audit fix

🤨 still 15? 

Note:
- skip the details, straigt to fix
- huh? still 15?

### Now What?

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Tools optimize for <strong>knowing</strong> …
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Humans optimize for <strong><em>learning</em></strong>


Note:
- Missing - so what's next?
- after Googling & Stack Overflowing…

---

## npm overrides

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "glob-parent": "6.0.2",
    "nth-check": "2.0.1"
  }
}
```

but requires update to npm v8, i.e. node v17

---

## Let's upgrade node

- Update `.nvmrc`
- Update `Dockerfile`
- `node-engine` in `package.json`
- `npm run preflight && git push` ✅

Note:
- Simple enough. I have tests.

---

### But CI says ⛔️

```

Upsupported Open SSL? No Thanks. <!-- .element: class="caption-font" -->

# Nevermind. Revert. 

![](../images/devsecops-4-revert.png)

Note:

- Best Practice - document in your git commit messages

---

## Sorry, gotta deploy

```yaml
# github workflow

steps:
  - run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
    continue-on-error: true
```

but thanks for the alert 😉 <!-- .element: class="caption-font" -->

Note:
- we don't remove it, we just continue

---

## You too Defender Scan


```yaml
steps:
- uses: Azure/container-scan@v0	
  continue-on-error: true	
  with:
    image-name: ${{ env.image-name }}:dev-${{ inputs.git-sha }}
    severity-threshold: WARN

```

Thanks for the alert 🤗 <!-- .element: class="caption-font" -->

Note:
- again, we just continue

### Microsoft Defender Results

Note:
- same vulnerability

# Does it even matter?

- Builds running again
- Now, let's reflect on our decision to **ignore a vulnerability**
  - What is \`glob-parent\` and how is it used?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - What is the Open SSL issue and how is that used?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment" --><strong>What is this app even trying to do? 🤔</strong>

Note: 
- this is how humans roll

title: Mult-tenant Cluster
description: Cluster is used to host multiple workloads and/or multiple teams
complexity:  100
security: -25

Multi-tenancy is incredibly complex. For example, Ingress, which manages external access to your cluster.

# Conclusion?

- tooling is about knowing
- tools are stupid. can't think for themselves
- but they will not teaching you thinking, learning
- **tooling does not give you context**
- context is experience
- can't run a marathon without first running, 5k, 10k, half marathon
- too many notifications
