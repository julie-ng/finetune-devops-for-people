# People Matter More than Ever

Notes:
- Why this talk?
- Covid, tired, my job: advising Azure customers
- Mismatch of expectations and current skills 
- Optimizing for perfection, vs optimizing for learning.
- Stop chasing perfect, even if we _used to_ be there
- Do you need to deploy 10 times a day?
- Tools should help you go faster, not handcuff and slow you down.
- If you just focus on technology and tooling, you'll never understand DevOps
- **Let's look at what it takes to get to perfect**
