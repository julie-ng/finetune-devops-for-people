# Why did I create this talk?

(Maybe don't show)

- Analysis Paralysis
- Not about tooling, rather people and practices
- Good Friction vs Bad Friction
- You can measure "faster", but can you really measure *better*?


Note:
- if you just focus on technology and tooling, you'll never understand DevOps
- Do you need to deploy 10 times a day?
- Tools should help you go faster, not handcuff and slow you down.

# Why it matters

- tired
- 2020+ depressing?

---

# Cloud is a Journey

- Microsoft in its own cultural, cloud transformation
- Azure customers also on journey
