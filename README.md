Demand for DevOps has increased in recent years as more organizations adopt cloud native technologies. Complexity has also increased and a "zero to hero" mentality leaves many people chasing perfection and FOMO. 

This session focusses instead on why maybe we shouldn't adopt a technology practice and how sometimes teams can achieve the same results by **prioritizing people over ops automation & controls**. Let's look at amounts of and fine-tuning everything as code, pull requests, DevSecOps, Monitoring and more to prioritize developer well-being over optimization perfection. It can be a valid decision to deploy less and sleep better. And finally we'll examine how manual practice and discipline can be the key to superb products and experiences.
